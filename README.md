Lets Hang - Let Your Friends Know What You Wanna Do and Where

  Lets Hang allows you to create an event, set a location for the event and invite your friends from all across social media to said event.  Has a large google maps view to see where the event is taking place.  You can message all who are invited, unless they decline the event, and the messages are in real-time. Which is great when things are up in air or there are last minute changes. There is a calendar app integrated into it allowing you to see all up coming events either you have create or are going to.
